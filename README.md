# CustomMozziWavetables

After being asked about making custom wavetables for use with the Mozzi library I've decided to upload a bunch of them here, along with a couple of quick and dirty python scripts I use. The first one takes an array of values and a name and makes a wavetable header file for use with Mozzi, and the other is a janky additive synthesis script with a variety of controls. Better explanations upon request.
