# CustomMozziWavetables

After being asked about making custom wavetables for use with the Mozzi library I've decided to upload a bunch of them here. The strange formatting you see on most of them refers to the harmonic series that produced them. For instance, "z2n1" refers to the 2n+1 series while "z6n5" refers to the 6n+5 series. Those wavetables labeled as "harmonics" are the waveform with the fundamental frequency missing; I did this to test a makeshift VCF idea.  Oh and the "z" at the beginning was just to smoosh them all at the end of the /tables folder.

I've also uploaded a couple of quick and dirty python scripts I used to make them. The first one takes an array of values and a name and makes a wavetable header file for use with Mozzi, and the other is a janky additive synthesis script with a variety of controls. 


Better explanations upon request (time allowing).   =)
